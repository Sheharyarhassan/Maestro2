It’s kind of like a lot of kids talking at once, but instead of sounding noisy, it all fits together to make one beautiful sound.\n His music can make you feel a lot of emotions - sometimes it’s joyful and lively, and other times it’s serious and thoughtful. Bach was great at using chords (a group of notes played together) to create different emotions in his music. ",

Even though he became deaf later in life, he still created some of the most amazing music ever. Beethoven wrote a lot of music, including symphonies, piano sonatas, chamber music, and operas.\n Beethoven’s music is known for its strong feelings. He could make you feel happy, sad, or even excited just by listening! He liked to use big changes in volume and tempo. One moment, the music might be soft and gentle, and the next, it could be loud and intense. This keeps listeners on their toes and connected to the music!\n  His pieces have so much feeling in them, it’s like watching a movie. He really takes you on a journey.",

Stravinsky loved to use unusual and interesting rhythms. His music often has strong, surprising beats that make you want to move!\n Stravinsky used dissonance, which means notes that sound a bit harsh or clash with each other. This creates tension and excitement in his music, making it feel very dynamic. It also can make you feel a little off balance and never sure what’s coming next!",
